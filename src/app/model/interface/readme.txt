We use MongoDB, a NoSQL database, so we shouldn't
use a relational way to manipulate a NoSQL database
(eg. use many id to relation)

We store data redundently to relation many to many datas

As the datas are multiple, we
use id to relation
so that if we change one thing
we don't need to change so many things related to it.
